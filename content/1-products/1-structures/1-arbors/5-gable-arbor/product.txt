Overview: 

The Gable Arbor is a truly elegant arbor reminiscent of fine English gardens. This arbor is constructed of beautiful Western Cedar, which is naturally resistant to decay and insects. Leave the cedar as is for a natural weathered grey look over time, or treat with a weather resistant stain or clear coat to conserve its original beauty. The Gable combines the soft curve of the braces with the traditional angularity of the gable style. Includes 4 steel anchors for securing arbor with cement.

Assembled dimensions (width x depth x height): 44.5" x 29.5" x 88.75"
Inside Opening: 35.75"
