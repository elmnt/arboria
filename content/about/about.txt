**Arboria** products are designed and manufactured by LWO Corporation of Portland, Oregon. Since 1980, LWO Corporation has developed a nationwide reputation as a designer and manufacturer of innovative, high-quality wood products for the home and garden. We are proud to feature distinctive, high quality sustainable furniture and garden structures as part of our **Arboria** family.  

Our garden structures are made right here at our factory in Portland, Oregon from natural and renewable Western Red Cedar, Douglas fir and other fine woods. Our complete line of casual furniture crafted from superior grade, sustainable hardwood is designed by **Arboria** and built in Vietnam.  

Our philosophy of integrating fine design, materials and craftsmanship and our dedication to customer satisfaction are the legacy of years of experience working with clients to improve the quality of the spaces in which we live and play. This tradition of excellence continues with ongoing development of innovative new products and improved construction techniques.

In addition to the **Arboria** lines, LWO manufactures the Woodway product line, which includes high-grade wood lattice, deckrail, post cladding, post caps, fencing products and interior solid wood paneling.
